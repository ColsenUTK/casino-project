What went well: Every function we sought out to create from the onset ended up being made, so the casino has the full functionality that we originally intended.
What went less well: Planning in synchronizing our halves of the code did not go as well as planned. For example, the Blackjack function returns a negative value if 
    you lose your initial bet, but the play() function had expected it to only return 0. As a result, double the actual amount was being lost. Although this was a relatively quick fix,
    in a larger codebase, this could have caused more widespread issues, so it is definitely something to be cognizant of in the future.
What you may have learned: Primarily, using git to manage a codebase. Other than that, the project was a nice refresher on almost every topic covered in 202, from vectors
to random number generation to sets. 
Why you should get full discretionary points: The code covers a wide range of functions that showcase significant positive learning outcomes and growth from topics covered this semester.
The code is well commented and formatted, and the functions run well, with clear guides on how to use them.
